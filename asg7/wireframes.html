            <h2>Wireframing Questions</h2>
                <div class="questions">
                <h3>What are the advantages and disadvantages of sketching wireframes over wireframe software?</h3>
                    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Some of the advantages of sketching your wireframes is that it can be a lot quicker to make the wireframes
                    because there is no need to learn a different software and you can get started right away. You can also be a lot
                    more flexible with potential things you might add, since there are no restrictions to what elements you are limited
                    to added compared to a software, which isn't guaranteed to have everything you might want to include. There's also
                    room for less distraction since you won't necessarily have all the options for making everything look pretty and get
                    caught up in visual parts that don't need too much attention at the wireframing phrase.<br><br>
                    <strong>Cons:</strong> However, some of the cons of sketching compared to using a wireframing software is that it's not easily
                    transferrable to other platforms beyond just your sketch on paper. This makes it harder to edit or make changes to what you had,
                    and if you wanted to make it easier by putting it into a software, you'll still have to put in the work again which can be
                    annoying. Sketching is also not ideal because you can't really communicate your work that well compared to a software, where
                    you can link you elements together (demonstrating flow of your website and interactivity) and there's overall more structure
                    for standardization and understanding of what an element represents/is supposed to do. It's also just harder to collaborate
                    with others if you're doing sketches. Online softwares make collaborations easier, guarantees you're working with the same
                    tools, and simultaneous working.

                <h3>Write a paragraph on which type of wireframing style would work best with your project and why.</h3>
                    <p>I think that the best type of wireframing style for my project would be a medium fidelity wireframing on a digital
                    software. This would work best because medium fidelity allows for me to demonstrate how one might interact with my
                    website and get one place to another. I can also show how elements are connected or their functions while also not having
                    to overwhelm myself or others with visual aspects. I am also prone to changing my ideas so not having something too detailed
                    will help me not waste my time on things I'm not sure of or feel like I need to commit to a design choice just because I
                    already have it made. So digital softwares are also easier in that case as well, where I don't have to put in more
                    effort that is needed if I change my mind on something.
