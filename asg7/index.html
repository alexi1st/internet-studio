    <p><a href="https://roblox.fandom.com/wiki/Player:Builderman" target="_blank">Builderman</a> is a Roblox character that many Roblox characters first
    interacted with on their first day of playing Roblox. He greeted new players and also sent important messages to players. He was the first friend to
    many on the application, and overall left a big mark on the Roblox lore although he is not present today. He has an iconic yet simple look, repping
    an orange builder man's hat, simple gray jacket zip-up with Roblox printed on it, and then plain pants and shoes.<br><br>
    I think that Builderman would be a great leader of the internet world because he exhibits friendliness. He has a
    calm yet charming demeanor, which ideal for a leader. Since he was the first one many people were friended with on Roblox, this shows
    that he is socialable and gets along with people. This trait is good for implementing diplomacy. He also worked as a messanger for the players, which
    show that he is good at communicating and is reliable at relaying information. He informs the people.<br><br></p>

    <h2>Running Mate</h2>
    <p>Roblox <a href="https://roblox.fandom.com/wiki/Noob" target="_blank">Noob</a> would make a good running mate for Builderman in running the internet world
    because Noob comes from humble beginnings and truly knows the depths of the internet. While Builderman is used to a kinder internet, Noob has firsthand faced
    the true hate and bullying that is brought upon the internet. Noob aims to make changes based on their own experiences and greatly understands the problems
    behind the bad parts of the internet.</p>

<h2>Campaign Platform</h2>
    <p>For Builderman's campaign platform, his campaign slogan would be "Building a Better Future for Man." Since he is going to be the leader of the internet world,
    he would grant better internet restrictions and assure that the internet does not have bad things on it. Builerman is also focuses on kind, welcoming morals so heHe would also grant Robloxians robux as needed to help stimulate
    would bring attention to making the internet a kinder place and less full of trolls, ragebaiting, and haters.
    the economy (but wisely). I think that he would also really emphasize listening to what internet users need or want and what changes should be made. Ever since
    Builderman became more inactive, the internet has gone crazy so if Builderman came back then the internet would be better.
