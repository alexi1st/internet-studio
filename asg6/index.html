	<h1>Six Thinking Hats Discussion</h1>
	<section class="summary">
		<h2>Discussion Summary</h2>
		<img src="img/yellowhat.png" width="200px" height="200px">
			<p class="og-summary">
			Each of the hat discussions touched on different viewpoints that should be considered
			when building my website. The white hat helped look at the project from an overall beginner's
			approach, the red hat touches on emotions for the idea, and the black hat considered potential
			problems or oppositions to think of. The yellow hat discussion took into account the importance
			of the website and certain features, the green thought of ways to think outside of the initial
			idea and expand, and finally, the blue hat allowed for a final conclusive discussion on all hats
			that were talked about.

			<h3>White Hat</h3>
				<p>The white hat defines certain questions and information that are needed when making the
				website. Based on what I discussed with my partner, the information that I have includes the
				idea that many people enjoy going out to cafes, bakeries, libaries, etc. to go out and do work
				or study. However, I still might need information on more environments people like beyond the
				ones I listed or even <em>why</em> they prefer to do this.
				</p>
			<h3>Red Hat</h3>
				<p>For the red hat discussion, my partner and I felt that my idea for my website would be useful
				and something we would enjoy using since we both like going out and studying at cafes. Since we felt
				this way, we concluded that many other students and workers would enjoy this services. However, even though
				we found this service useful and assumed it was a good idea, there was a concern on just how functional the
				service would be without a proper user base that isn't big or interactive enough.
				</p>
			<h3>Black Hat</h3>
				<p>Black hat discussion consisted of asking pressing questions that point out potential flaws of my website.
				Some of the things we were able to think of when thinking from this perspective is "what if there are people
				who like studying beyond just cafes, coffee shops, libraries, etc., and prefer to study somewhere more unique
				that can't be added onto the website?" We also expanded more on our concern of how the service will rely heavily
				on user contributions (leaving reviews, marking spots, categorizing, etc.), but many people might not be incentivized
				to contribute, and the beginning launch of the service could be very slow and underwhelming if there's a lack of
				information for users who want to look for spots. 
				</p>
			<h3>Yellow Hat</h3>
				<p>The yellow hat was a bit of a turn in thinking when coming from the initial black hat thinking. We were able to
				discuss more of the positives of the website, but in a reasonable, logical way. If the website were able to gather a
				big, interactive, contributing userbase, the reviews woud feel more genuine and informative since it's from real people
				who share similar motives to going to a certain place. By doing so, it would make it easier for people to find a place
				they like to study/work at.
				</p>
			<h3>Green Hat</h3>
				<p>Green hat perspective allowed us to think a bit outside of the box for my idea and ways to consider expanding it. For
				one thing, since my website will have an aspect of rating the "vibes" of a place (cozy, corporate, artsy, minimal, etc.),
				people can use this sorting system for beyond just the place they'd want to "study" at, but also as a way to find somewhere
				their friends can go to for a casual outing. As for addressing the black hat problems, when it comes to "unique" places that
				differ from the typical study spaces, I can always implement a "misc" category. I think it's important that when the website
				first "launch", there should be an ample amount of spots already listed for suggestions, and perhaps ratings grabbed from other
				sources until more reviews from actual users on the platform are added.
				</p>
			<h3>Blue Hat</h3>
				<p>To conclude the hats, the blue hat helped provide one final general overview for the project after discussing everything
				else. When discussing, the subject was easily defined as "study areas/work spots". Ultimately, the goal of my website would be
				helping others find a comfortable place to study or do work.

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p class="og-summary">Overall, discussing my project throughout the six thinking hats helps me think about different perspectives
	when approaching my project. Each hat highlighted different considerations, and in turn made me question deeper on how I could
	either fix or embrase certain aspects that were discussed. There are many valuable things that need to be thought upon and taken
	into account. I think I've definitely started considering more ways I can take on my project with a more "out-of-the-box" thinking approach.
	I also realize that there are more problems than I initially thought, so it's up to me to navigate how I will "solve" them or
	work around them, since they could ultimately make or break a user's experience if the problem excludes them.
