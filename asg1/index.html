			<h2>Semester Project</h2>
			<p>For my semester project, I think that I would like to make a website that focuses on finding the best study spots. It would locate cafes, coffee shops,<br>
			bakeries, libraries, etc. that are best for studying and other useful information like seating and busy hours. I would would also like it to have a rating system<br>
			where you can add your thoughts or comments on a certain location, and maybe even a feature where you can categorize places based on what vibe the establishment<br>
			gives off.</p>
