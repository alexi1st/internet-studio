	<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
	<h2><strong>Three Things that I Learned:</strong></h2>
	  <ol>
		<li>There have been different phases of the web, and each have introduced new ways of sharing things online and consuming content.</li>
		<li>New methods and tools are constantly being made to improve web development.</li>
		<li>A decentralized website is operated independently away from a central authority/server. Having no single point of control allows<br>
		for better security and less limitations from centralized authorities.</li>
	  </ol>

			<h2>Semester Project</h2>
			<p>For my semester project, I think that I would like to make a website that focuses on finding the best study spots. It would locate cafes, coffee shops,<br>
			bakeries, libraries, or maybe even find specific spots on college campuses. It could also contain useful information like seating or busy hours. I would also<br> 
			like it to have a rating system where you can add your thoughts or comments on a certain location. Additionally, a feature where you can categorize/sort out<br>
			different characteristics of a certain establishment.</p>
