                    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matty_Healy">Matty Healy</a> from The 1975 is my least favorite artist. Although I liked a few songs from The 1975, I don't like Matty Healy
                because he has said some questionable stuff that I do not agree with. Healy has said and done stuff that were racist, misogynistic, and rude so I don't
                really like him as a person. Overall, he's pretty controversial so I prefer not to listen to his music.<br><br>

                for his lyricism, musical eclecticism, provocative onstage persona characterised as performance art, and influence on indie pop music.
