            <h1>Favorite Movies Gallery</h1>
            <p>These are twelve movies that I enjoy, some of them being my favorites. Movies like<em>The Edge of
            Seventeen, Lady Bird, The Florida Project,</em> and <em>Moonlight</em> are enjoyable to me because I like
            the coming-of-age/realism aspect to it. It reflects on experiences that other people can relate to. The other
            movies like <em>The Menu, Knives Out,</em>and <em>Saltburn</em> are ones I liked because of their plot twists
            and writing. <em>Legally Blonde</em> is a movie I liked because it has girlboss energy and is iconic. <em>
            Mickey 17</em> and <em>Isle of Dogs</em> are notable for me because I remember really enjoying them for the
            themes. However, my top two favorite movies are <em>Interstellar</em> and <em>Everything Everywhere All at
            Once</em> because I particularly found them to be fantastic cinematic pieces of work that evoked very strong 
            emotions within. I enjoyed their themes relating to family.</p>
