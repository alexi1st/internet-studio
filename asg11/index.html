    <h1>Dodgeball Team</h1>
       <p>This is my dodgeball team that I formed called the <strong>Dodgeball Human Beings.</strong>
        This team consists of five members: Jeff Winger from <em>Community</em>, Gihun from <em>Squid Games,</em>
        Harold from <em>Total Drama Island,</em> Ben Chang from <em>Community</em>, and then Chill Guy,
        an iconic, world renowned meme known for his nonchalant yet serene presence on the internet.

            <h2>Jeff Winger</h2>
            <img src="img/jeffwinger.png" width="250px" height="250px">
            <p>First person I chose for my dodgeball roster is Jeff Winger. He would be fit for my dodgeball
            team because he tends to be very competitive given the right circumstances. Although he might hate
            the other members on his team and ultimately would cause some tension, he would be able to see it
            through and give a detailed motivational speech that encourages everybody–leading to a flawless victory.

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Gihun</h2>
            <img src="img/gihun.png" width="250px" height="220px">
            <p>The second pick for my team is Gihun from the Squid Games. I chose Gihun because not only is
            he a strategizer, but he also has intense main character energy and therefore by law he just
            cannot lose. He's also really good at coming up with a plan, especially if something isn't working
            out he'll try to work around it. He's observational too and will most likely scan his opponents,
            noticing patterns in their throws and predicting their next move.

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Harold</h2>
            <img src="img/harold.jpg" width="250px" height="250px">
            <p>Harold is my third pick for my team. I picked Harold because he has already proven himself in
            dodgeball through a Total Drama episode. He is able to dodge the balls with ease which will frustrate
            opponents and diminish their energy throughout the duration of the game. While dodging is his strong
            suite, this valuable skill is what could ultimately take our team to the end and possibly leave him
            as the last one standing.
            </p>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Chang</h2>
            <img src="img/benchang.jpg" width="250px" height="250px">
            <p>Chang is my fourth pick. Chang, while probably not that good at dodgeball, I feel would provide
            the team with an energy that is unmatched. A motivating but simultaneously degrading team spirit
            that is less than ideal but somewhat necessary. This energy will be the main catalyst
            leading up to Jeff's big speech which will turn the tide. If not, Chang is also known for his
            rather unethical practices regarding getting what he wants, so the win will be earned no matter
            what through his (unjust) efforts.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Chill Guy</h2>
            <img src="img/chillguy.jpg" width="250px" height="250px">
            <p>Chill guy is my last pick. I chose him because I recognize that there is always that one
            player in each team who lowkey does not contribute anything but is there for moral support and to
            spread good vibes. So Chill Guy is here because he'll turn the inevitable tension of the team to a
            more serene, laid-back vibe with just his presence. He'll keep everybody grounded with reality and
            serve as a reminder not to blow up any emotions too intensely. He's the overarching peacemaker.
