                        <p>Olivia Rodrigo is a very popular music artists of the new generation. I would like to have dinner with Olivia Rodrigo because I like her music but also because she's
                    a Filipina queen. I often refer to her as "Ate Olivia" ('ate' is a respectful term to refer 'older sister' 
                    in Filipino) as a joke so I think it would be funny to actually meet her. Beyond just her music, I also think she's really nice
                    and I look up to the fact that she isn't afraid to speak up for what she believes in while being a big artist. Overall,
                    she seems like a very passionate and genuine person, so I feel like she would be a very pleasant person to meet and have
                    a meal with. </p>

                        <p>Lorde is a singer and songwriter from New Zealand. I would like to have dinner with her because she is my favorite musician and
                        her music has been very impactful to me after many years of being a fan. I also find her songwriting very incredible, so I would like
                        to discuss where a lot of her inspiration is derived from and what she plans on working on next. I would also like to learn more about
                        her development throughout the years and how she has become more comfortable with herself and her identity while not caring what anybody
                        else thinks. I would also want to tell her how much I enjoyed the production and performance of her concert.

                        <p>Troy and Abed are an iconic bestfriend duo from the show <em>Community.</em> Although they are technically two separate people, I feel
                        as though there are various storylines throughout the show that emphasize their friendship, therefore reinforcing the idea that they "complete" eachother and are better together, which ultimately allow them to be
                        their true, creative, and weird selves. So it wouldn't be fair to pick just one of them.<br><br>
                        But yeah, their weirdness and creativity would be one of the main reasons I think I would enjoy having a dinner or meeting them. I think that their dynamic would be very interesting to encounter and
                        I would ask a lot of questions regarding their interests and place in the friend group.</p>
