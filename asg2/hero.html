                <p>A <a href="https://hero.fandom.com/wiki/Sackboy" target="_blank">Sackperson</a>, often refered to as Sackboy due to his generic appearance being of a boy, is the main protagonist of the LittleBigPlanet franchise, along with being the mascot of the PlayStationâ€”or more specifically, the PlayStation 3. 
                    He also appears in the crossover fighting game, PlayStation 
                    All-Stars Battle Royale as a playable character. Sackboy was born March 15th, 1999, making him around 24 years old.<br><br> He is a creative hero among Craftworld, often protecting it from both internal and external threats, with his first journey in the series having him rescue various characters from 
                    the Collector in LittleBigPlanet 1. He is well-renown among Craftworld, especially after the events of LittleBigPlanet 2, which was when Craftworld faced its biggest threat in the form of the Negativitron. He also saved Carnivallia in LittleBigPlanet PS Vita and Bunkum in LittleBigPlanet 3. In Sackboy: 
                    A Big Adventure, he saved Craftworld from Vex, along with rescuing his own race, leading to him being dubbed "Knitted Knight of the Imagisphere" by Scarlet.<br><br>
                    For most of the series, he was portrayed by Kenneth Young, who did his vocalizations for when Sackboy was imploding or drowning. In Sackboy: A Big Adventure, which made Sackboy completely vocal despite not having lines, he was portrayed by Darin Nagada, Leo Hart, Dexter Norbury-Bell, and Elliot Cundy.
