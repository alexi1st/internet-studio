            <h2>Conversations With Robots: Voice, Smart Agents & the Case for Structured Content</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The difference between structured content and semantic HTML in a webpage is that structured content is
                        used in order to organize and better help communicate to the machine certain information. It also establishes
                        a hierarchy between elements. Semantics in HTML helps better give meaning to elements and describes
                        what something is to the browser. It gives elements a label and can also be useful to developers who need to identify what
                        something is.
                        </li>
                        <li>By combining both structured content and semantics, this will better improve effective communication of proper
                        information across various platforms or devices.
                        </li>
                        <li>It's important to have structured content and semantic HTML in a webpage because this assures that you are
                        providing proper visuals of your information to viewers, but also using the correct markups to
                        make your webpage understandable to the browser too. Both work to improve machine readability, accurate information retrieval, and
                        increases the overall user experience.

                <h2>Websites Similar to my Project Idea</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong><a href="https://medium.com/%40amandamyang/nooks-enabling-students-to-find-the-perfect-study-spot-2cd02ca9b914" target="_blank">Nooks </a>(App)</strong></li>
                            <p>While Nooks is an mobile app rather than a website, this is the closest thing I could find that was the most similar to my idea,
                            as it focuses solely on finding study spots.
                            </p>
                        <li><strong><a href="https://www.lib.uci.edu/study-space-locator" target="_blank">UCI Study Space Locator</a></strong></li>
                            <p>This website exclusively focuses on study spots at UC Irvine, however it still shares a very similar purpose to what I 
                            want to include.
                            </p>
                        <li><strong><a href="https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=study+spots&find_loc=Fort+Worth%2C+TX+76104" target="_blank">Yelp</a></strong></li>
                            <p>Yelp is used to find all kinds of spots. You could also find study spots on here and read reviews, so I'd say the mechanics are
                            the same, but my website would be geared specifically for studying.
                            </p>

                    <h2>Questions for Readings</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Of the methods that are presented in Jacobs's article, I would say the most effective ones for me would be shifting my thinking
                            and focus, specifically the "giving yourself some props" point she makes. I find myself doing this frequently already, and it's a good way
                            for me to remember what I'm capable of, as well as motivating me to make something for my future self to look back on and be proud of.
                            It's also a reminder of the other times I pushed passed that "troll" and managed to come out with something good, even if I initially thought
                            what I made was subpar because I was too busy listening to the inner critic.<br>
                            Another effective one would probably be "changing the target: being deceptively non-commital". I think I struggle a lot with starting something
                            but never committing to it, however I've recently been trying to shift my thinking based on a lecture I've received before. This point highlights
                            a good way to trick yourself into a better mindset of just "showing up". I've learned that if you just show up, despite being unmotivated or
                            feeling uncommitted, you're still more likely to get something done than if you didn't show up. So I think that this point shares a similar
                            sentiment that I value.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>"Hyperbolic discounting" is our ability prefer instant rewards that are small rather than larger rewards that are delayed. One method that McRaney
                            identifies to counteract hyberbolic discounting is recognizing that there's a you in the future and you in the present. Both versions will
                            probably be influenced by different things and wants, but it's important to hold future you accountable by making the right choices now, since you
                            cannot rely on future you to do what's right. He mentions essentially "tricking" your future you by doing things that present you can commit to,
                            but at the same time will also be something future you has to deal with (in a good way). I feel like being able to trick my future self into doing
                            something would work best.
                            </li>

                            <li>Network-making power that I have as a publisher is deciding on what content I choose to share and my webpage is based around. Ultimately, since
                            they are in a space that I made, I can share whatever ideas I have and even choose how they interact and engage with it. However, as a publisher,
                            I don't really have much control over the visibility of my site.
