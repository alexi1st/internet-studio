		Fleetwood Mac are a British-American rock band formed in London in 1967 by singer and guitarist Peter Green. Green named the band by combining
		the surnames of drummer Mick Fleetwood and bassist John McVie, who have remained with the band throughout its many line-up changes.
		Fleetwood Mac have sold more than 120 million records worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling musical acts.<br><br>
		
		Primarily a British blues band in their early years, Fleetwood Mac achieved a UK number one single in 1968 with the instrumental 
		"Albatross" and had other UK top ten hits with "Man of the World", "Oh Well" (both 1969), and "The Green Manalishi (With the Two Prong Crown)" 
		(1970). Green left the band in May 1970 and McVie's wife, Christine McVie, joined as an official member on vocals and keyboards two months later, 
		having previously contributed to the band as a session musician. Other key members during the band's early years were Jeremy Spencer, Danny Kirwan, 
		and Bob Welch. By the end of 1974, these members had departed, which left the band without a guitarist and male singer. While Fleetwood was 
		scouting studios in Los Angeles, he heard the American folk rock duo Buckingham Nicks, consisting of guitarist and singer Lindsey Buckingham and 
		singer Stevie Nicks. In December 1974, he asked Buckingham to join Fleetwood Mac, with Buckingham agreeing on the condition that Nicks could also 
		join. The addition of Buckingham and Nicks gave the band a more pop rock sound, and their 1975 album Fleetwood Mac topped the Billboard 200 chart 
		in the United States. Their next album, Rumours (1977), reached number one in multiple countries around the world and won the Grammy Award for Album 
		of the Year in 1978.
