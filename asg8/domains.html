                <h2>Domain Discussion</h2>
                <p>I discussed the possible domain names with my peer. For the domain name <strong>"studysprout.co"</strong>, the person I was discussing with
                    really liked this one compared the others because it felt easy to say. Although I also liked this name, I mentioned how it felt a bit too
                    specific with the <strong>"study"</strong> part in the name when my website is not exclusive to study spots but also work spots. As for <strong>
                    "introspotive.com"</strong>, at first she didn't like this one because it sounded like it was trying to hard. But since this was my favorite one out
                    of the domain names I came up with, I tried to further justify/reason it with the meaning behind it and how it sounded cool, and eventually she was more convinced of it
                    and it having a chance of being chosen. As for <strong>"spotbloom.co"</strong>, she said it was kinda forgettable and made no sense, which I kinda
                    agreed with as I felt pretty indifferent towards this name. I also shared some of my visions for the aesthetics/style regarding each domain name, since
                    each one gives off a certain vibe. It was agreed upon that <strong>"introspotive.com"</strong> had more of a modern, minimalistic vibe compared to the
                    other two, where I thought they had a more earthy/growth aspect to them.<br><br>
                    The domain name that I ultimately like the best is <strong>"introspotive.com"</strong>. I particularly like this one because
                    it's a play on the word "introspective", which is kinda catchy, creative, and interesting. I think it reflects on the concept of one
                    being able to find what their preferences are whenever they go to an environment with the means of being in a state of focus while
                    doing work or studying. The inclusion of the word "spot" also shows what you are meant to find as a result of my websiteâ€“your "spot".</p>
