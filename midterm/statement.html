            <h3>Design Statement</h3>
            <div class="statementtext">
            <h4>Overview</h4>
                <p>For my midterm project, I did it over the country of Switzerland as it is the destination I would love to visit the most.
                When it came to design decisions, I ultimately chose to go for a more minimal, modern, and somewhat sleek web design.
                I chose to go this direction because when I thought of Switzerland, I imagined that it would have a clean, understandable, and
                efficient identity that reflects on the values of Swiss culture. I also know that I would be including a lot of beautiful
                pictures of Switzerland, so keeping a minimal design made sense so that the actual visuals of the country would catch viewer's attention in
                an easy way while not overwhelming the user with too much decor or content. There's a sense of quiet and calm in the design, as it's not too crowded or overloaded
                with information, which I felt was essential to demonstrate what one might feel when traveling here.
                </p>
                <h4>Color Palette</h4>
            </div>
            <div class="colorpalette">
                <div class="color red">#e20000</div>
                <div class="color darkred">#b40000</div>
                <div class="color darkgray">#3b3b3b</div>
                <div class="color lightgray">#e2e2e2</div>
                <div class="color white">#ffffff</div>
            </div>
            <p>This is the color palette I chose. I kept it very simple as I mentioned I wanted a minimal and modern approach to my website. The gray any
            white were used most commonly for the navigation, headers, text color, and background colors, while the red was used as an accent to bring attention
            to buttons that might be considered more important, such as the explore button in the navigation bar, discover more button, and submit form button. In
            the homepage I also applied the red background to the fun facts section since I wanted to further establish the color palette and website mood on the
            first page people will see.
            </p>
            <div class="typography">
                <h4>Typography</h4>
                <div class="types">
                    <h6 class="montserrat">Montserrat</h6>
                    <h6 class="karla">Karla</h6>
                </div>
                <p><strong>Montserrat</strong> and <strong>Karla</strong> are the two typefaces that I chose for my website. I chose Montserrat to be the typeface for main headings,
                labels, etc., while Karla was associated with body text and other smaller text labels. Montserrat has a very modern feel to it which makes it
                feel serious and clean, while still having a wider x-scale and round curves that communicate a friendly, inviting vibe, which I liked for my website
                as I wanted it to feel credible but usable. Overall, Montserrat provided simplicity and clarification while still feeling approachable.<br><br>
                As for the typeface <strong>Karla</strong>, it seemed like a good fit for bodies of text as it looks very precise and readable. It also created a nice contrast to
                the thickness of Montserrat, which helped build more hierarchy of elements and allows users to distinguish the level of information provided. It was a choice
                made to fit the modern, minimal approach while not being too similar or different from Montserrat.
                </p>
                <h4>Buttons</h4>
                <p>For the button decisions, I went with a simple approach of having flat, sharp-edged buttons. For most things, I kept
                the look of sharp edges rather than rounded since it felt more fitting to keep it that way as the Swiss flag is a prime
                example of geometry–from its uniquely squared flag to the bold cross in the middle. Keeping buttons sharp also helped
                keep up with the modern website style.<br><br>
                Since this is a travel website, I also wanted to make sure that a lot of the important buttons stood out and were accesssible. To make them stick out,
                I either put them in red, added borders, or placed it in an intentional way that didn't feel out of place, but made sense in the context of the information
                given (such as the booking/reserve buttons on the "Things to Do" and "Places to Eat" webpages). Some buttons I put on different areas of a page, such as
                the CTA "Book Now" in the homepage hero, but also on the navigation for every single page. There's also a "Contact Us" button for both the navigation and
                footer for the same reason of accessibility and convienence.<br><br>
                A very specific button choice that I went for was the "Explore" button on the navigation bar. I decided to make one singular dropdown button with the "Things to
                Do" and "Places to Eat" webpages because I didn't want to crowd the navbar with too many options.
                </p>
                <h4>Interaction Design</h4>
                <p>For the interaction design, I added very subtle animations/movements that weren't overwhelming or "felt like too much" to the site's tone and style. Short,
                smooth motions added more life and dynamic to the site, giving it a responsive feel. There's a slide in of the navigation bar each time a new page is opened
                or refreshed, along with a fade-in of all the other site contents. I added this because this helps users note when they enter a new part of the website, especially
                 since the "Things to Do" and "Places to Eat" have identical layouts, the animation helps create that distinction of webpages.
                </p>
                <h4>Images</h4>
                <p>For the images, I made sure to pick ones that really embody what Switzerland provides and were relevant in the context that it was being used. I made sure not to cut
                any images off strangely and that they were cropped adequately for viewing. 
                </p>
